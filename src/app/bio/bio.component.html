        <div class="bio-text">
            In 2014, I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Computational Media Student from the Georgia Institute
            of
            Technology. My studies involved computer programming, design, and understanding the computer as a medium.
            While
            my more personal interests include film, narrative, and animation, I am open to experience other branches of
            my
            field such as UI/UX Design, game development, marketing, cloud, and web development.
